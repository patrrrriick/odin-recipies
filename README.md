# odin-recipies
Before the Project: Applying the knowledge gathered from the TOP HTML Foundations and familarising myself with GitHub basics while creating a basic recipe website.
After the Project: Applying HTML for this particular project was fun and straightforward. Need to be careful of minor errors such as typo's. Still need further practice familarising myself with GitHub basics.
